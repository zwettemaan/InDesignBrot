# What it is

_InDesignBrot_ has no practical purpose - it's more of a 'fun' thing.

It visualizes the MandelBrot set in InDesign using small 
frames arranged in a huge grid.

_InDesignBrot_ is a sample of the scripts that can be created with 
_UXPScriptSparker_ - it is one of the options in the 'Starter Code' 
dropdown menu.

_UXPScriptSparker_ is a free and open source project to create 'starter' 
projects to get your feet wet with InDesign and UXPScript. 

https://github.com/zwettemaan/UXPScriptSparker

_InDesignBrot_ has a 'dual' nature - it can be run as an ExtendScript 
as well as a UXPScript.

# How to install InDesignBrot

Start InDesign 2023 or higher

Bring up the Scripts Panel (_Window - Utilities - Scripts_)

Double-click the _InDesignBrot_idjs_ script on the InDesign Scripts panel.

# How to tweak

You can tweak the parameters for InDesignBrot by editing the info on the
pasteboard of the sample document.

Don't go overboard - start with small increases first (e.g. add 5 or 10
to the current value of `num pixels`).

Take note that the execution time increases dramatically with increasing
values of kNumPixels. E.g. a setting of `num pixels = 100` takes many 
minutes to execute in ExtendScript.

There are a few sample .indd file provided in the download, which shows the 
result with `num pixels = 100`, to save you from calculating it yourself.
